title: Research Retrospectives
description: A paper is only able to have so much information, and rarely do we tell the stories of research in academic writing. These blog posts cover both the stories behind the research as well as additional thoughts which need a place different than a paper to live. All thoughts are my own and don't reflect anyone else's.
